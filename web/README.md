# Frontend

## Styles

### React Components

- Use functional components
- Props use should be described by types, not interfaces
- Explicitly declare props, don't use FC
- Use named exports, not default.
  - Exception is for /pages where default exports are required.
  - Page should be a named component, then export as default at the bottom of the page.
